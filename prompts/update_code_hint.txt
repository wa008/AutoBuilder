Please write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to achieve the given goal. Structure your output as follows:
1. The first part should be a plain text answer, which split with second part with "-------------------"
2. The second part should contain the code. Separate the sections of different files with a single line marked "-------------------".
3. For each file section:
	3.1 The first line should display only the file name, without any extra text or symbols (e.g., no ** or code block markers).
	3.2 The following lines should consist of the raw content of the file, such as code, without comments, syntax tips, or additional formatting.
4. Do not include any blank lines before or after the separator line.
5. Avoid summaries, notes, or any content that is not part of the file's raw code.
For example, you can output:
xxxxxxxxx
